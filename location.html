        <p> A cute vintage farm house in the middle of the hipster industrial wasteland of Bushwick, Brooklyn, will be the setting of our wedding.</p> 

        <p>The Vander Ende-Onderdonk House is the oldest Dutch colonial stone house in New York City. Peter Stuyvesant granted the land it sits on in the mid-seventeenth century, and by 1660, Hendrick Barents Smidt occupied a small house on the site. In 1709, Paulus Vander Ende of Flatbush purchased the farm and began construction of the current house.</p>

        <p>The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1995.</p>

        <div class="h1">How to Get There</div>
        <p>You can easily get to the Onderdonk House from anywhere within Manhattan or Brooklyn using public transportation, taxi, or car.</p>

        <p><strong>Driving / Parking:</strong><br/>
            If you are driving, there will be street parking on the side of the house, on Onderdonk Avenue.
        </p> 

         <p><strong>Taxi / Uber / Lyft:</strong><br/>
            A taxi from Manhattan will take around 30 minutes and cost approximately $30 - $40. By law they can only sit four people at a time. In Brooklyn, it will take you 15 minutes, and cost $20 - $25.<br/><br/>
            If you have a smart phone, we recommend using Uber or Lyft as it will be easier to hail rides at the end of the night, and the price is similar to that of a taxi.
        </p> 
       
        <p><strong>Public Transportation / Metro:</strong><br/>
            Take the <span class="train-line">L</span> train to Jefferson Street in Brooklyn. It will be a short 10 minute walk to the Onderdonk House from the train station.<br/><br/>
            We recommend taking a stroll down Troutman Street on your way there to see all the beautiful street art.
